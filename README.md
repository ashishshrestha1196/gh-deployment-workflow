# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** by automatically deploying a static website to **GitHub Pages** whenever the `index.html` file changes.  
It helps understand how GitHub Actions can automate repetitive tasks like deploying updates without manual intervention.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Execution

### 1. Repository Setup
- Repository name: `gh-deployment-workflow`
- Files included:
  - `index.html` ‚Üí Simple static website
  - `README.md` ‚Üí This documentation
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` ‚Üí GitHub Actions workflow

### 2. GitHub Pages Configuration
- Enable GitHub Pages in the repository:
  - Go to **Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Build and deployment**
  - Source: **Deploy from GitHub Actions**
  - Branch: `main`
- This provides a public URL for your website:

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow
- Workflow triggers **only on changes to `index.html`** in the `main` branch.
- Steps performed:
1. Checkout the repository
2. Configure GitHub Pages
3. Upload the website artifact
4. Deploy the artifact to GitHub Pages
